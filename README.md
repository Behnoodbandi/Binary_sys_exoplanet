# Binary_sys_exoplanet
Simulation of exoplanets in binary systems for Simulation course in Amirkabir University of Technology

We simulated motion of an exoplanet around a binary system that has same mass stars with a circular orbit in three dimensions.
In this repository, you can find simulation results for five different orbits. There are graphs of orbit shape and Lyapunov Exponent. Also, you can find Simulation MATLAB code.
We will be happy if you tell us your comments.
